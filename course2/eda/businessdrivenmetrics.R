# TO-DO
# A vector contains the scores of a player in various innings
# Write a function that takes in the vector as input and returns the number of centuries scored by the player. 

centuries <- function(player_vector){
  # store the centuries scored by the player in centuries
  # Please enter your code below
  
  
  sum_centuries <- 
    
    
    #---DO NOT EDIT THE CODE BELOW---#
    return(sum_centuries)
}

# Test - Passing a vector - c(120 ,30, 134, 16,102) to your function
centuries(c(120 ,30, 134, 16,102))
# The ideal output should be: 3
